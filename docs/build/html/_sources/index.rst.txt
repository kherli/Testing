**Hello and Welcome!**

We are a team of scientists and citizen scientists, all united by a shared passion for the aurora! Together, in the `Auroral Research Coordination: Towards Internationalised Citizen Science (ARCTICS) <https://collab.issibern.ch/arctics/>`_ group, weâ€™ve combined our expertise to create two valuable resources for the aurora community.

Our Aurora Field Guide provides examples of various types of auroras, helping you recognize and identify different forms in your own photographs. Meanwhile, our Aurora Handbook delves deeper into aurora chasing, capturing images for scientific research, and contributing to our collective understanding. We explain the process of taking and submitting your photos, how collaborations between professional scientists and citizen scientists unfold, and highlight key discoveries that have emerged through this teamwork.

These guides are available to you free of charge, and we hope that you enjoy them! Happy aurora hunting from the ARCTICS team!
